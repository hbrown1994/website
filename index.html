    <p class="intro">
      I'm a composer, music technologist, improviser, and percussionist based in
      Chicago, Illinois. The heart of my work is creating fluid musical
      spaces by enabling unpredictable, spontaneous, and idiosyncratic
      interactions between human performers and digital media. I'm particularly
      into the aesthetics of digital failure, glitch, and sonic extremes within
      the contexts of mixed music and computer music.
      <br>
      <br>
      My most recent compositional practice is focused on combining sounds generated from
      digital audio failures with acoustic instruments and human performers. I have
      been exploring what it means to recreate these sounds of digital failure on
      acoustic instruments and then recombining these faux orchestrations of digital
      failures with the actual digital failures themselves. These explorations create
      an uncanny valley within the audio domain that leaves the listener with a sense
      of disorientation and otherworldliness. Essentially, I want the listener to feel
      as if they are being routed through many reconstructed digital spaces, like being
      zipped all over the world via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in which various
      forms of digital exhaust and trash make an appearance. Many of the digital sounds
      I work with are generated by both randomly occurring and self-provoked failures
      within commercial audio software systems and low-level audio synthesis.

      Some of my more technical computer music work focuses on designing artificially
      intelligent computer music systems to be used within the context of
      human-machine free improvisation. You can see some of this work and
      read more in the "Research" section on this page.

      I'm currently studying towards a PhD in Music Composition at the University
      of Chicago under the tutelage of Sam Pluta and Augusta Read Thomas.
