    <p class="intro">
      Hunter Brown is a composer, music technologist, improviser, and percussionist based in Chicago, Illinois. His musical practice focuses on creating fluid musical spaces by enabling unpredictable, spontaneous, and idiosyncratic interactions between human performers and digital media. In particular, his music explores the aesthetics of digital failure, glitch, and sonic extremes within the contexts of electroacoustic music. As a music technologist, Hunterâ€™s research focuses on designing artificially intelligent computer music systems to be used within the context of human-machine free improvisation. Hunter is currently studying towards a PhD in Music Composition at the University of Chicago under the tutelage of Sam Pluta and Augusta Read Thomas.
