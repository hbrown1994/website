              Hunter Brown is a composer, improviser, and audio engineer 
              based in Chicago, Illinois. 


              His practice is focused on creating unpredictable, 
              idiosyncratic, and unruly interactions with digital technology. In particular, he is 
              interested in exploring the unstable material properities of digital systems though 
              technological mediated listening and by pushing the physical mechanisms of digital technology to the 
              threshold of failure. 

            </p>

            <p>
              Hunter’s work has been presented internationally at festivals, conferences, and universities 
              such as: Big Ears Festival, Ear Taxi Festival, High Desert Soundings, Conference on AI Music 
              Creativity, Line Upon Line Composer Festival, University of Huddersfield’s FluCoMa Plenary, 
              New Interfaces for Musical Expression, International Workshop on Multilayer Music Representation 
              and Processing, International Computer Music Conference, Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in 
              the United States National Conference, IRCAM Manifeste, and more.
            </p>
