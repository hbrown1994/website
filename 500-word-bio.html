              Hunter Brown is a composer, improviser, electronic musician, and audio engineer based in Chicago and Berlin. His experimental practice explores sonic perception, representation, materiality, and abstraction through works spanning fixed-media electronic music, mixed-media electroacoustic compositions, live-electronic music, sound installations, and interdisciplinary performances. Hunter's technologically focused approach involves custom software systems that push the physical limits of digital technology through bespoke analysis and synthesis algorithms, machine learning and artificial intelligence, machine listening, psychoacoustics, and spatial audio. His recent work investigates the latent spaces between the unstable material properties of digital audio systems, standardized machine listening protocols, and human sonic perception.
