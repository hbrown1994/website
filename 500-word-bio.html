              Hunter Brown is a Chicago-based musician and audio engineer whose experimental practice explores sonic representation, digital materiality, and computational abstraction through composition, improvisation, and performance. His work often foregrounds a technologically driven approach, employing unconventional analysis and synthesis algorithms, machine learning, artificial intelligence, machine listening, psychoacoustics, and spatial audio. Hunter's projects have recently focused on the connections between human sonic perception, machine listening, and digital artifice.

Hunter is involved in several ongoing improvisation-based projects, including Technical Reserve (with Dominic Coles and TJ Borden), Other Plastics (with Dominic Coles), Clout (with Jakob Heinemann), and the Brown/Wong Duo (with Eric Wong). He has also collaborated with a range of musicians, including Carol Genetti, Chris Riggs, Ishmael Ali, Jack Langdon, Jack Wright, Kieran Daly, Ken Vandermark, Molly Jones, Michael Speers, Michelle Lou, Peter Maunu, Riley Leitch, and Tom Weeks.
