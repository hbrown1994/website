                  ◦  "A trio of Sun Yizhou, Hunter Brown and Dominic Coles offers music that is all abrasive blasts and cuts, stuttering into regular rhythms that almost immediately shift out of sync. Sudden, gaping silences are followed by impromptu pairings in which the performers echo each other in disjunctive cascades: a set full of crackling energy, tensile yet static, the audience hanging on every sound."

                  ◦  "In Hunter’s Stoppages, a meticulous and raw collection of works, where can we locate his particular wanting? Behind the technological and computational rigor, 
                  'the austere aesthetic, and the cold, caustic, digital sounds is something much softer, much warmer. At the core of these pieces is a desire that things be different – that 
                  the world as shaped by our malicious impulses, our greed, our insecurity, and our violent lust for acknowledgment were to be re-formed. If you know Hunter then this begins 
                  making quite a bit of sense: beneath the surface is something extremely gentle. Does Stoppages suggest an action towards the transformed world and way of being that the work 
                  so desires? I’m not sure I have an answer yet, but my instinct tells me it has something to do with the rupture, of breaking things apart and letting our desire leak out. 
                  Hunter does the work necessary to cause the first crack - it’s up to us to place our ears against the hole and listen as the gap widens."

                  ◦  "Although Hunter Brown’s Stoppages considers an aesthetics of failure as a starting point, encapsulating the points made above, this project seems to orbit its 
                  own space outside of other post-digital glitch music practices. The politics of this piece may center around control, but rather than merely exploiting system failure 
                  and bringing to our attention the fallible nature of digital technology as still very human-based, this album expansively allows us to dream."

                  ◦  "Brown picks up David Tudor’s ideas on the generation and transmission of electronic sound and runs with them into new digital territory, 
                  pushing the idea of synthesis and glitching further than most... The results are alarming, particularly when the system flatlines and your hi-fi’s level meters 
                  are pegged by silence. Apparently unedited, each piece is defined by the amount of time it took before the programme crashed, creating inexplicably arbitrary structures 
                  of sound and silence. When the frequency spectrum looks like this, you know it’s uncompromising."

                  ◦  "The two of them cook up a pair of severe, spatialised noise studies that keep turning aggressive, but the harshness is tamed and sculpted by responding to the acoustic 
                  dynamics of the apartment, using the placement of their bluetooth monitors as EQ to exert stern but fair authority over brittle electronic sounds."

                  It could be argued that what’s displayed here is that digital sounds are alive, or that real sounds are artificial, or that both share the same murky middle-territory.

                  ◦  "almost leisure has a much more defined thesis than the duo’s traditionally improvised debut, its sprawling sound-map of decontextualized conversation and spatial wormholes 
                  evoking the uncanny humor and illuminations of Network Glass’s Twitch user anthropology. As is probably clear by now, any of these could easily hold its own as a distinct release,
                   but I think PP-01 is greater than just the sum of its parts."

                  ◦  "A trio of two laptops & one pedaled-up cello, Hunter Brown, Dominic Coles, and TJ Borden threw an eclectic & original vernacular at us – one that no one was ready for... Around midnight, it seemed as if we were launched into an immersive historical survey, illustrated by paradoxically paired genres of structureless free jazz and rigid 
                  serialism. Through jurassic growls, explosive feedback, silences of space, and instruments of war, the trio suggested that what makes us unique as human beings is our unwavering 
                  curiosity. At this point, the outdoor classroom that is the quaint courtyard of The Palms were now littered with stimulated, engaged minds, with Bach, Coltrane, and Stockhausen 
                  acting as our instructors on behalf of the trio sitting in front of us."

                  ◦  "Experimental music is about trying shit and seeing what happens. Yet there’s plenty of that experimenting happening with Borden, but his cello-and-electronics improvisations, 
                  fed into and manipulated by the rigs (or whatever what they’re using is called) of Brown and Coles, present a genuine interplay between the musicians, and for me that almost 
                  always feels more human and risky. Most of the pieces are bite-sized tremors that writhe and sizzle before going silent, but there are some more, uh, measured excursions... The music 
                  often moves at breakneck pace, but the interactive sensibility is never lost. Definitely one of the most convincing free improv sessions with real-time processing I’ve heard since 
                  discovering Sam Pluta years ago."

                  fully synthetic sounds, with a dry negative space surrounding all the instruments. I absolutely love this sound, but then on top of that, there's a momentum in the full 
                  album experience that comes from most of the pieces clocking in under two minutes, individual moments can show some patience with their sounds but overall there is a constant 
                  forward movement that makes this a fantastic experience. Do not miss this one!"

                   but the collisions and connections between Borden’s hyper-tactile cello sounds and the harsh electronics elevates the synthetic element. It could be that I just 
                   can’t locate the more rigorous machinations within the electronics, so I find the cello-electronics divide more transparent, but either way they all prove to be 
                   exceptional listeners with stop-on-a-dime reflexes."

                  improv, supposedly reliant on technique yet really in need of desperation as the spur to invention. Technical Reserve takes us back to a simpler time when the gear doesn’t work 
                  the way it’s supposed to, albeit now captured with pornographic clarity. It’s rude and it’s noisy but, to pursue the wrestling analogies that crop up in the sleeve notes, for this

                  frayed cords and broken-open devices. Opener “Dommy Speaks,” in a short and raucous flurry, displays the distinct palette of artificial emission and erroneous electrical chaos 
                  with which they will be working over the eight successive tracks; the austere blasts of caustic digital noise and budget sine tones are certainly in a similar vein as the work of 
                  other more “academic” electroacoustic improvisers, but there’s always a unique freedom to Overtime Liquor, a barely audible but persistent whisper of anything goes beneath the

                  sophisticated micro chatter or back away to protect your ears from jarring mixer feedback. At barely over a half hour, the album is a suite of brief freak-outs and a couple 
                  long-playing, ever-evolving environments that, while sonically on another planet, invoke the whimsy, oddity, experimentation, and complexity of Anton Webern's compact oeuvre."
