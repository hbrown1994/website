            <p>
            <strong>Latent Enclosures</strong> is a sound installation that reveals, transforms, and resynthesizes latent sonic phenomena within an enclosed space.
            A custom sound analysis system captures impulse responses from multiple locations within a room and processes them to uncover acoustic 
            qualities perceptible and imperceptible to the unaided human ear: prominent and non-prominent resonances, noisiness, temporal 
            reflections, and other emergent characteristics detected by automated machine listening algorithms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Recorded sounds from within the installation and real-time acoustic feedback are filtered through these transformed impulse responses, 
            which articulate and modulate the room’s latent acoustic properties. As listeners move among strategically placed microphones and 
            speakers, their physical presence modulates the room’s acoustics, and their auditory experience fluctuates in relation to their 
            position within the space.
            <br>
            <br>
            The same analytical processes applied to the room’s impulse responses are also employed to deconstruct recordings captured within 
            the installation. This resynthesizes the machine’s perception of these sonic events while establishing a link between sounds produced 
            by participants, environmental sounds originating beyond the installation space, and the ways in which obfuscated, enclosed digital 
            systems render sound and shape auditory experience.

            This documentation consists of an hour-long direct capture of the system’s output. While a binaural version 
            has been produced to enhance the work’s spatiality, the recording cannot fully represent its perceptual and 
            spatial qualities, as the acoustic space itself plays a critical role.
